The files in this folder are used as templates when creating new files.
They overwrite the default templates from the Unity installation,
for example (on Windows): "...\UnityEditor\2019.2.0f1\Editor\Data\Resources\ScriptTemplates".
More file templates (shaders, state machines, assembly definition...) can be found in this location.
